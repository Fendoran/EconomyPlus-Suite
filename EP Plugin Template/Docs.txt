So you want to make your own plugin?  That's great, here is a simple guide on what tools we have prepared for you.

First of all, your UID needs are taken care of.  We have 2 ID systems, which are very reliable.  They are the following:

1. UUID - more overhead, but also much more robust
2. Session - very lightweight, but should only be used for temporary things

The UUID system uses the player's actual UUID because it will NOT change.  So we can have reliable (and returnable) UUIDs.
function directory:uid/get - copies the executing entities UUID into scoreboards (#ep.uid0-3 ep.variable)
function directory:uid/copy - copies the scoreboard (#ep.uid0-3 ep.variable) into the executing entities UUID's score (think of opposite uid/get, and should only be ran by non-player entities)
function directory:uid/compare - if the executing entities UUID scores matches the ones in the scoreboard, then the entity receives the ep.pass_uuid_check tag, make sure to remove this tag as soon as possible

The session system works as an incremental id system, but it gets changed every time a player logs in, so it should only be used for temporary things.
(scoreboard is called ep.session)

Once you have figured out the ID systems, you can take advantage of our built-in function tags
These tags executing similarly to #minecraft:tick, but for different events, so as to streamline the plugin process


The following tags exist (and can be viewed in the economyplus folder):

load - works same as #minecraft:load, but is executed from the load file in core
tick - works same as #minecraft:tick, but is executed from the tick file in core
player_load - works when player is loaded for the FIRST time (only once per player)
player_tick - ticks as all players, use @s to reference the player
player_login - works every time the player logs in
player_death - runs when the player dies


Finally, please rename plugin to the name of your plugin, and don't forget to link to EconomyPlus core in your plugin's download
